# Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis

## Overview  
This is my **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project**.  
The goal was to analyze **12 months of Cyclistic bike-share data** to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** use the service differently.

## Data Source  
The dataset is publicly available through [Divvy/Cyclistic Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).  
- Data covers 12 months (one year).  
- Each month was provided as a CSV file.  

Due to size limits, the full raw dataset is not uploaded here. Instead, this repository includes:  
- A cleaned dataset (Excel file).  
- The Tableau workbook used for analysis.  
- Screenshots of dashboards.

## Process  
1. **Data Collection** → Downloaded 12 months of trip data.  
2. **Data Cleaning (Excel)** → Combined files, removed duplicates, handled nulls, and created new columns such as ride_length and day_of_week.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** → Compared member vs casual rider patterns.  
4. **Visualization (Tableau)** → Built dashboards to highlight trends.  

---

## Key Insights  
- Casual riders take **longer rides** on average than members.  
- Members ride more consistently on weekdays, while casual riders prefer weekends.  
- Seasonal trend: casual riders increase usage in summer months.

## Visualizations  
This repository includes:  
- `tableau/Cyclistic_Analysis.twbx` → Tableau workbook file.  
- `tableau/` folder with screenshots of dashboards.

## Tools Used  
- Excel → Data cleaning and preparation  
- Tableau → Visualization and dashboards

## Conclusion  
Cyclistic can increase annual memberships by adjusting pricing and benefits:  

- Reduce the annual pass price and extend ride-time (e.g., from 1 hour daily to 3 hours).  
- If the annual pass is $9 per month, introduce a **premium option** at $15 per month with up to 9 hours of daily ride time.  
  - This appeals to heavy casual users (e.g., working professionals commuting daily), who currently see better value in daily or weekly passes.  
- Add extra perks to the standard annual pass (e.g., 1–2 bonus hours) to further increase adoption and satisfaction.
